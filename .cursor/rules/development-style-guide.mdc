# Development Style Guide

This document outlines the key principles to follow when working on this project. Adhering to these guidelines ensures consistency and quality.

## Language

### Project Content
- **All project content must be in English.** This includes:
  - All user-facing text and UI elements.
  - Code comments and documentation.
  - Commit messages.
  - Variable names and function names.

### Personal Communication
- **Personal communication between developers can be in Chinese** for better understanding and efficiency.
- **Project deliverables and documentation must remain in English** for consistency and accessibility.

## Coding Principles

- **Minimize Modifications:** Make only the changes necessary to complete the requested task. Do not refactor or restyle code unless it is part of the core request.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid code duplication. If you find yourself writing the same code in multiple places, abstract it into a reusable function or component.

## Project Structure

The project contains several simple browser-based games. The main entry point for the website is [index.html](mdc:index.html). Each game is located in its own directory under `/games/`.

- [BlockFall](mdc:games/BlockFall/index.html)
- [snake](mdc:games/snake/index.html)
- [story](mdc:games/story/index.html)
- [typing-rain](mdc:games/typing-rain/index.html)
